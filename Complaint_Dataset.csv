Got a call from 5317951057 and 5317951057 number claiming to be courier service staff and said they have received a parcel from me, which has drugs and a police complaint has been raised as well.
The call was forwarded to policeman, told me to download Skype on phone. I was further asked to share an image of Aadhar card. the fake policeman told that 3-4 criminals are misusing this Aadhar card, hence the police want to conduct an inquiry about bank accounts. 

The person then asked to transfer 1540141 to an account in SBI bank (RTGS). I was told that the money will be transferred back to  bank account if deducted. I said, I dont have that much amount in my bank, he said its ok and its just a dummy transaction.

Online Loan Fraud,"I engaged with an individual Rajiv Ambani, purporting to be the Chief Investment Officer of ICICI Securities. This individual shared links 
After downloading the app, I followed the advice provided and made investments in Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). Consequently, my initial investment of ?7.2 lakh had escalated to ?9.2 lakh, as reflected in the app.
A significant issue arose when an IPO was listed on 12 April 2024, resulting in an allocation of approximately ?17 lakh, which I was unable to invest. Subsequently, a partial investment of approximately ?9 lakh was automatically executed in the IPO without my consent. Upon contacting customer care to rectify the situation, I was coerced into accepting a loan of ?9 lakh to subscribe to the IPO under duress.
Following the successful sale of the IPO with a substantial profit, my wallet balance reached approximately ?24 lakh. Upon requesting a withdrawal and attempting to return the loan,  I was informed that my account was on hold until the loan was repaid. The customer care representative insisted that I transfer the loan amount to the following account
Branch: SHASTRI NAGAR Account Type: Current Account  Name: N K ENTERPRISES Acc NO: 50200088708321 IFSC: HDFC0006598
Upon realizing the fraudulent nature of the situation, I refused to comply with their demands. Subsequently, I received threatening messages from the purported repayment specialist at ICICI Bank or my social reputation."

But I did not take loan from it

But after a day or two Rs 3500 came into my account

Then I thought I would return it

Today when the date came to repay that payment I started getting calls at 9 in the morning

I tried a lot to return the payment to them but their upi id was not accepting my payment so I also posted a screenshot of the error the other person was getting on WhatsApp
But he did not agree and started abusing me unnecessarily and started posting my nude photos to me and those whose mobile numbers I had given to the relatives also posted my nude photos on WhatsApp

And hes still calling

The series of +92 was also included in his incoming calls

Online Loan Fraud,"I downloaded an application, Slice Personal Loan App (Green Color Icon) on 10th April 2024, the purpose was to get some credit loan however we were unaware about the authenticity of this application. 
The moment we uploaded documents we felt doubtful about this app, we decided to give up taking any loan from this app. After that we have uninstalled the application, yesterday in the morning around 8.39 am I started getting messages & call from this guy named Deepak Kumar from an international number on whatsapp, The number was +6373346473, the moment i answered the call he started abusing and threatening me over the phone, i kept on asking him what loan are you talking about? because as per our knowledge no loan applied through any platform he mentioned about, then he sent me the link of the same app i decided not to get loan. I opened the app and found the loan was disbursed on 11th April without any message, any notification, without any email. By the time we could have decided more how to pay back he started sending my contact list by threatening he is going to call family members also started sending cropped vulgar photograph with my face on it. He was not ready to listen & continued threatening & hung up. 
Then we opened the app again and captured the UPI ID (6373346473@ucobank) which was mentioned there, we paid the due amount of Rs.1500 and submitted the proof of payment. I am concerned about my data access which he can misuse further.

Defamation,"Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to complaint against Mobikwik for engaging in unlawful activities. Its about breach of privacy, defamation, and potential cybercrime perpetrated by Mobikwik.

I availed myself of the ""Paylater"" facility provided by Mobikwik, utilizing an amount of 24,847.20 rupees. Regrettably, due to unforeseen financial constraints, I was unable to make the payment on time, resulting in the balance becoming overdue. Subsequently, I initiated a payment of 17,000 rupees to settle the outstanding amount, leaving a remainder to be paid.

I have discovered that Mobikwik has engaged in grossly unethical and potentially illegal practices by accessing my personal contacts stored on my mobile device without my explicit consent.

Furthermore, Mobikwik has undertaken reprehensible actions by making unsolicited calls to individuals within my contact list, falsely portraying me as delinquent in payment and besmirching my reputation amongst my acquaintances, family, and society at large.

These actions constitute serious breaches of privacy, defamation, and potentially criminal behavior under relevant cyber laws.

I hereby request the Cyber Crime Division to conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of Mobikwik and take appropriate  legal action against the company for its unlawful actions. 

I am willing to provide any further information required to facilitate the investigation. I trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency.

Thanks,
Gurvider"

Defamation,"I, Monika Sharma, would like to lodge an FIR against Naveen Dabas for his continuous online harassment and attempts at defamation. 
Naveen Dabas and I were acquaintances during our time as students in a pathology course back in 2002, and we maintained a friendly relationship. However, the situation
has escalated in recent years, leading to significant distress for me and my family.
The harassment began in 2019 when Naveen Dabas created multiple fake accounts on Facebook and repeatedly sent friend requests despite my refusal. 
His actions escalated to the point where he resorted to sending abusive messages and continued to create fake profiles even after I blocked them. 
Furthermore, he started harassing my sister by sending messages to her, prompting her to also block him on Facebook.

The harassment did not stop there, as Naveen Dabas brother, Sumit Dabas, also attempted to connect with me on Facebook, which I promptly blocked. 
Recently, Naveen Dabas has extended his harassment to other social media platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat, sending unwanted messages and friend requests.

The situation has become unbearable as Naveen Dabas has gone to the extent of obtaining my mother mobile number and making distressing calls to her. 
He has also contacted my sister friend, Neha, on Facebook Messenger, asking about my activities and urging her to disclose my personal contact details and share
address details."

I am writing to file a complaint regarding the defamation of teachers and the use of obscene and profane language on [online instagram)which, I believe, violates cybercrime laws and community standards.

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally complain about the behavior of a person associated with the phone number +7013829657, who is identified as my friend Arna.

Yesterday, a miscommunication occurred between us on whatsapp at around 12:30am and despite my attempts to diffuse the situation and take responsibility for the misunderstanding, Arna continued to provoke and harass me. I explicitly requested her to stop the matter, but she persistently initiated an argument, eventually blocking me on WhatsApp.

Subsequently, I resorted to iMessage, and unfortunately, my engagement in the argument led to the use of offensive language by Arna. She not only mentally bullied me but also defamed my character, discussing aspects of my nature in a derogatory manner.

Defamation,"I am writing to bring a matter of serious concern to your attention We have been facing threats harassment, and defamation by someone named Rajni with whom we collaborated for a podcast production in April Unfortunately the collaboration was terminated in July  and since then we have been subjected to unwarranted attacks on our reputation

Rajni had initially paid us a sum of 11000 and upon ending the collaboration requested a refund Despite having completed a significant amount of work we refunded her 1500 as a goodwill gesture However she continues to associate our name with unrelated issues and insists on dragging us into her personal matters

Regrettably, these actions have taken an alarming turn with Rajni resorting to sending threatening messages during the night, attempting to shame us over her past issues. It is important to note that we have no personal connection with her beyond the two months of our professional collaboration and we have since blocked her due to the persisting harassment

We are deeply disturbed by Rajnis continued attempts to tarnish our reputation falsely labeling us as frauds and unjustly defaming our work and personal names. We suspect that there may be underlying mental health issues as she seems to be hallucinating and irrationally connecting us to her unrelated past problems

We kindly seek your assistance in resolving this matter promptly to alleviate the ongoing harassment and stress that we are enduring"
